## üõ∞Ô∏è Overview

This project integrates NASA satellite data with local sources (SEDAPAL, SENAMHI, CENEPRED, and others) to build an interactive geospatial platform that visualizes environmental and urban information on a map. The goal is to support urban planning and risk management in human settlements across Lima.

## üß≠ Objective

To develop a data-driven tool that combines information about water, air, land, and natural hazards to identify critical areas, predict risks, and prioritize sustainable actions that improve quality of life and urban resilience in vulnerable communities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

* Water: Monitors water availability using NASA‚Äôs GRACE-FO, SMAP, and IMERG datasets combined with local SEDAPAL records.
* Air: Tracks and predicts air pollution (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ) using MODIS, MAIAC, and LANCE data, integrated with local monitoring stations.
* Land: Detects illegal dumping sites and land degradation through Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery, optimizing waste collection routes.
* Natural Hazards: Uses IMERG (rainfall), LHASA (landslide susceptibility), and FIRMS (fire detection) to generate real-time early warnings.

## üå± Impact & Alignment

The project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ‚Äî
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
SDG 13: Climate Action
SDG 15: Life on Land

It aims to directly benefit more than 50,000 residents in Lima‚Äôs human settlements during the first two years of implementation.
